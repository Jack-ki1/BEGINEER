Project 4: Data Cleaning & Automation (Web Scraping + EDA)
Objective: Scrape real-world data, clean it, and create dynamic visualizations.

Dataset:
Option 1: Scrape IMDb movie data (using requests + BeautifulSoup).

Option 2: Use COVID-19 Dataset for time-series analysis.

Key Python Libraries:
Data Cleaning: pandas, numpy

Web Scraping: requests, BeautifulSoup

Visualizations: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, folium (for geospatial)

Step-by-Step Questions:
Beginner (Data Extraction & Cleaning)
Scrape movie data (Title, Rating, Year, Genre) from IMDb.

Load data into a Pandas DataFrame and clean missing values.

Convert data types (e.g., Year to integer).

Extract genres into separate columns (one-hot encoding).

Intermediate (Exploratory Visualizations)
Matplotlib: Plot a histogram of movie ratings.

Seaborn: Create a boxplot of ratings by genre.

Plotly: Make an interactive scatter plot of Rating vs. Year.

Folium: (If using COVID data) Plot cases on a world map.

WordCloud: Generate a word cloud of movie genres.

Advanced (Automation & Dashboards)
Automate data scraping and cleaning in a .py script.

Build a Plotly Dash dashboard with filters (e.g., by year/genre).

Use Bokeh for an interactive time-series plot (for COVID data).

Apply PCA to reduce dimensions and visualize clusters.

Save visualizations as HTML/PDF for reporting.
